### Abstract

Innovation is key to the long-term prosperity of humanity, yet buyers of innovative products, such as solar panels, often face economic disadvantages due to rapid depreciation of these products. Energeticoin offers a cryptocurrency-based solution to this problem by creating a decentralized cooperative network. By rewarding buyers with ENGC tokens, Energeticoin enables them to offset their purchasing costs and participate in the future development of the industry. Suppliers can attract more buyers by accepting ENGC as part of current and future payments, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that promotes technological innovation.

Energeticoin is secured by an energy-efficient Proof of Spacetime (PoST) consensus mechanism, enhanced for greater security and efficiency, and is built using the asset-oriented smart contract language Scrypto from Radix. Energeticoinâ€™s tokenomics are designed to reward developers, early investors, industry experts, suppliers, and buyers alike, while promoting price stability and long-term ecosystem growth.
