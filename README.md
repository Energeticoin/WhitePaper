### Abstract

Innovation is key to the long-term prosperity of humanity, yet buyers of innovative products, such as solar panels, often face economic disadvantages due to rapid depreciation of these products. Energeticoin offers a cryptocurrency-based solution to this problem by creating a decentralized cooperative network. By rewarding buyers with ENGC tokens, Energeticoin enables them to offset their purchasing costs and participate in the future development of the industry. Suppliers can attract more buyers by accepting ENGC as part of current and future payments, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that promotes technological innovation.

Energeticoin is secured by an energy-efficient Proof of Spacetime (PoST) consensus mechanism, enhanced for greater security and efficiency, and is built using the asset-oriented smart contract language Scrypto from Radix. Energeticoin’s tokenomics are designed to reward developers, early investors, industry experts, suppliers, and buyers alike, while promoting price stability and long-term ecosystem growth.

## The Current Status: Pre-Seed Fundraising to Launch Energeticoin

I am currently raising **pre-seed funding** to get Energeticoin off the ground. This early-stage funding will enable me to set up the necessary entities, develop the blockchain infrastructure, and build initial partnerships with industry players.

### Who Can Invest?
I welcome accredited investors worldwide who share my vision of supporting innovation through blockchain. **Pre-seed investors** will help me create the foundation of Energeticoin, supporting both the technical development and the establishment of the corporate and nonprofit entities that will organize the ecosystem.

I am particularly interested in investors with a passion for **blockchain technology**, **renewable energy**, and **innovative industries**. Depending on your country’s regulatory framework, you may need to qualify as an accredited investor. This generally includes:
- Individuals or institutions with significant financial resources and investment experience.
- Entities such as banks, investment firms, or trusts with assets exceeding certain thresholds, depending on local regulations.

The criteria often require high net worth, but some jurisdictions such as the EU allow persons with relevant experience to be classified as elective professional clients without high net worth requirements. If you are unsure about your eligibility, please consult your financial advisor or contact me for further clarification.

### Why Invest in Energeticoin?

Investing in Energeticoin offers the chance to support **real-world innovation** while potentially benefiting from the long-term success of a project with global impact.

**Key benefits for early investors:**
- **Equity and Long-Term Value**: Pre-seed investors will receive a stake in the company and share in its future success.
- **Strategic Impact**: Your capital will help lay the foundation of a global blockchain platform that incentivizes sustainable development.
- **Innovative Tokenomics**: A unique structure will be built to stabilize the ENGC token price and prevents extreme price volatility, ensuring long-term value for all participants.

### Use of Funds
The funds from the pre-seed round will be used to:
1. **Establish key entities** (Energeticoin Blockchain, Energeticoin Maker, Energeticoin Store, Energeticoin Nonprofit) required for the functioning of the ecosystem.
2. **Develop the blockchain infrastructure**, including PoST enhancements and smart contract functionality.
3. **Launch marketing efforts** to onboard early Suppliers and Buyers of innovative products.
4. **Build partnerships** with renewable energy companies and other innovative industries.

### Compliance and Legal Structure

Energeticoin is fully committed to complying with international securities laws and regulations. The pre-seed round is being conducted through **private placements**, ensuring compliance and limiting participation to accredited investors where required.

This is **not an ICO**; rather, I am raising funds to build the foundational infrastructure of the project. All investments will be handled transparently, and participants will be required to meet **AML/KYC** requirements to ensure compliance with international regulations.

Please note:
- This is a **high-risk investment**, as is the nature of early-stage projects. While I am confident in my vision, there are no guarantees, and I recommend potential investors consult with financial advisors before committing.
- The **ICO might occur at a later stage**, once the project infrastructure and entities are in place.
